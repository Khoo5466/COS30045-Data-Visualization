                This project explores the impact of food supply and consumption on global health, focusing on how poor diets contribute to chronic diseases and premature mortality. It examines food as a non-medical health determinant, highlighting how high-calorie, low-nutrient diets—often due to socioeconomic and 
                environmental factors—drive non-communicable diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. By analyzing a dataset on food supply (including nutrients like fats, sugars, and calories) and consumption patterns (such as fruit and vegetable intake), the project aims to uncover links between dietary
                 trends and health outcomes. <br><br>The project objectives include analyzing food supply trends to understand the availability of essential nutrients and how socioeconomic factors influence access to nutritious foods. It also examines dietary consumption patterns to identify shifts towards processed and unhealthy 
                 foods, particularly in low-income and urban settings, where access to fresh, nutritious options may be limited. Additionally, the project explores broader socioeconomic and environmental factors, including income, food security, and cultural preferences, that shape eating habits and create barriers to healthy diets, especially 
                 in marginalized communities. <br><br>By correlating dietary patterns with health outcomes, the project clarifies how poor diets contribute to chronic diseases. This analysis offers insights into the direct and indirect pathways by which food supply and consumption impact public health, underscoring the need for policy changes to enhance access to healthy foods. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer actionable policy recommendations and promote global health equity, emphasizing the importance of sustainable food systems, public health education, and multi-sectoral interventions. Through this approach, the project aims to support data-driven strategies to reduce preventable diseases and promote healthier, more sustainable lifestyles globally.

                    The bar chart illustrates trends in food supply types from 2010 to 2021, highlighting calorie, fat, sugar, vegetable, fruit, and protein availability. 
                        Over the years, calorie, fat, and sugar supplies remained consistently high, reflecting the global shift towards energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets. 
                        This trend is concerning, as excessive consumption of high-calorie and sugary foods is closely linked to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. 
                        Meanwhile, the relatively stable supply of vegetables and fruits suggests limited improvements in the availability of healthier options. 
                        To combat rising rates of lifestyle-related diseases and premature mortality,
                        there is a pressing need for initiatives that promote balanced diets and reduce reliance on processed, calorie-rich foods.</p>

                    The line chart illustrates the daily supply of animal and plant protein from 1961 to 2021, highlighting significant trends that may correlate with lifestyle and health outcomes. 
                        Over this period, plant protein supply fluctuates but generally declines, especially from the late 1980s to early 2000s, while animal protein supply remains consistently low, 
                        peaking only slightly in the early 1980s. Limited access to both protein sources—particularly plant-based proteins, which are often the primary source of essential nutrients in 
                        low-income regions—reflects a nutritional gap that could impact long-term health. Low protein intake is often associated with weakened immunity, stunted growth, 
                        and other health risks that can contribute to premature mortality. The trend suggests that a combination of poor food supply and possibly environmental factors may be leading to nutrient deficiencies,
                        which are crucial elements of an unhealthy lifestyle. Addressing these gaps in dietary intake could be an essential step toward reducing premature mortality rates and similar regions.
