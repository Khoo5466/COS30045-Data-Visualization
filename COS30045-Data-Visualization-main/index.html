                    The bar chart illustrates trends in food supply types from 2010 to 2021, highlighting calorie, fat, sugar, vegetable, fruit, and protein availability. 
                        Over the years, calorie, fat, and sugar supplies remained consistently high, reflecting the global shift towards energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets. 
                        This trend is concerning, as excessive consumption of high-calorie and sugary foods is closely linked to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. 
                        Meanwhile, the relatively stable supply of vegetables and fruits suggests limited improvements in the availability of healthier options. 
                        To combat rising rates of lifestyle-related diseases and premature mortality,
                        there is a pressing need for initiatives that promote balanced diets and reduce reliance on processed, calorie-rich foods.</p>

                    The line chart illustrates the daily supply of animal and plant protein from 1961 to 2021, highlighting significant trends that may correlate with lifestyle and health outcomes. 
                        Over this period, plant protein supply fluctuates but generally declines, especially from the late 1980s to early 2000s, while animal protein supply remains consistently low, 
                        peaking only slightly in the early 1980s. Limited access to both protein sources—particularly plant-based proteins, which are often the primary source of essential nutrients in 
                        low-income regions—reflects a nutritional gap that could impact long-term health. Low protein intake is often associated with weakened immunity, stunted growth, 
                        and other health risks that can contribute to premature mortality. The trend suggests that a combination of poor food supply and possibly environmental factors may be leading to nutrient deficiencies,
                        which are crucial elements of an unhealthy lifestyle. Addressing these gaps in dietary intake could be an essential step toward reducing premature mortality rates and similar regions.

                        aggregate food consumption data available for that nation. Inside each country segment consists of arcs represent specific years of collected data, providing insight into food security trends within specific year.</p>
